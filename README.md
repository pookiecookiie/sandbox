Sandbox thingy


I tought of a sandbox 3D game where you can mess arround with ragdoll physics and funny stupid stuff to have fun with, cars, guns, explosions, minigames
and much more, i tought of a game where you could basically just add games to it.
Almost like minecraft, gmod, but be like godoto friendly to add new stuff.

So thinking about it, there would be a base game, where:

Player
  2D or 3D Model. 2D could be fun
  Animations, Kind of just, drop animations here directly to character states
  Basic Movement
  Interactions with stuff, like picking up boxes, interacting with buttons, sensors and whatever, to make it easier to expand upon


Interactable objects
  Like boxes, buttons, and so on


Levels, or worlds
  Create as many as you would like
  Mess arroud in worlds
  
  
 Honestly very crazy, I know, its just an idea I had, i might keep planning it.
